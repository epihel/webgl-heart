# webgl-heart
Rotates and moves a human heart using [Three.js](https://threejs.org) in a WebGL-enabled browser.

The heart models were generated by [Wavefront](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) and have been slightly modified from the [orginals](https://github.com/MattSchroyer/heart/tree/master/models).

To view, load **index.html** in a WebGL-enabled browser. To avoid same-origin errors when loading the model files, see instructions [here](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/introduction/How-to-run-thing-locally).
